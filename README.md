# SynSpine Dataset

## Dataset Description

The SynSpine dataset originates from the innovative SynSpine workflow, designed to create synthetic magnetic resonance (MR) data that realistically mimics longitudinal spinal cord deformations, such as cord atrophy. This dataset fulfills the crucial need for reliable ground truth data, enabling the evaluation and validation of advanced analysis algorithms.

The SynSpine workflow is executed in three key phases:

1) Synthetic MR Image Generation: The spinal cord is isolated, extracted, and scaled using the PAM50 template to produce synthetic MR images (on the PAM50 space).
2) Non-Rigid Registration: These synthetic images are aligned to the subject's native space through non-rigid registration, ensuring precise anatomical correspondence with the PAM50 template.
3) Noise Simulation: Rician noise is added to the synthetic MR images to accurately replicate noise patterns typically observed in MR imaging.
