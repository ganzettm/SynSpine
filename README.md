# SynSpine

Description of the dataset

This dataset is derived from the SynSpine workflow, a pioneering approach designed to generate synthetic magnetic resonance (MR) data that authentically simulates longitudinal spinal cord (SC) deformations, such as cord atrophy. This addresses the critical need for reliable ground truth data to evaluate and validate specialized analysis algorithms.
The SynSpine workflow consists of two phases: 
1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; 
2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject's native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. Images with various levels of simulated atrophy and Rician noise are provided.
